This is a complex flux residing in the "lobid/lodmill repo":https://github.com/lobid/lodmill/blob/master/lodmill-rd/src/main/resources/hbz01ES-to-lobid.flux .

h2. What it does

This flux demonstrates the ETL (Extract,Transformation,Load) capacity of metafacture:

1. As data source an elasticsearch index is _extracted_
2. The data (serialized in AlephMabXml) is _transformed_ using a morph-script into NTriples
3. These NTriples are _loaded_ into a Mysql DB

The flux with its tee-pipes does some more stuff in parallel:

- serializing the elasticserach stream into one big xml gzipped file
- creating a statistic about the field occurrences of the morphed data

h2. How to execute

For now it will only work if the lobid repository is checked out and the directory "lodmill-rd":https://github.com/lobid/lodmill/tree/master/lodmill-rd is built.

h2. Careful

Be aware that the used modules are not the official way to work with triples and
that especially "write-rdfmodel-mysql":https://github.com/lobid/lodmill/blob/master/lodmill-rd/src/main/java/org/lobid/lodmill/RdfModelMysqlWriter.java is kind of a workaround (as one limit of metamorph
is that receiving modules can pass only _one_ kind of value. This might be a
complex object, though (here it's an jena RDF model), so, since the receiver
also needs a way to determine the name of the record to store to, the property
to obtain that name from is given via the parameter
_property="http://purl.org/lobid/lv#hbzID"_ .This property is then used by the
module to extract the name of the record (the key) out of the jena RDF model to
store it into the MySql db)).  Albeit it's kind of a workaround: its working
and might give you a clue how to do that stuff if you are in need of it.
